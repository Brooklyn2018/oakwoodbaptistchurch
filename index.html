      <h3>A BRIEF HISTORY: This church has been here since 1900, but in 1920 is when an official foundation was built. When it first began, more and more people kept coming. Eventually, the regular visitation number had climbed up to 250; the highest it has ever been. But things went downhill from there. Pastors changed, and less people started going. The visitation number decreased drastically, until there were five people left. Then Pastor James Rogers showed up about two years ago, and the church now has 60 regular visitors and counting! We hope that you will be one of them!</h3>
